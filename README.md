# Image and Video Stitching
This algorithm runs through a video file, or a set of images, and stitches them together to form a single image.

## Quick Start
Getting the app running is pretty simple: clone, install the requirements, and run!

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Arsen204/image-stitcher && cd image-stitcher

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the stitching!
python stitch.py <path to image directory or video files> --display --save
```
